# Hello, I'm Jacob Zukas
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I'm Jacob Zukas, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate from Florida Polytechnic University with a concentration in Cybersecurity/IT Security. I bring hands-on experience from penetration testing projects, fullstack development, and cyber defense competitions like CCDC. With a foundation in tools like Splunk, Snort, and Wireshark, and a passion for secure systems, I'm eager to contribute to innovative security teams and keep learning in this ever-evolving field.

## Objective
Leverage my Security+ certification, hands-on full-stack development experience, and proven cyber-defense skills to build secure applications, contribute open-source security tools, and continuously learn advanced penetration-testing techniques. My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a SOC as an Information Security Analyst.
